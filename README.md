NullDC-Linux
==========

WARNING:
=======

This project has not been worked on since 2013. I don't know enough about porting the DirectX pixel shaders to OpenGL. I recommend you look into using Reicast instead: https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator.



A port of the Dreamcast emulator NullDC to Linux.

This project has just started, and does not yet work.

TODO:
=====

* Replace MS specific features with C++x11 features
* Move from MS Visual Studio 2013 Express to CodeBlocks
* Port GUI to WXWidgets
* Port Graphics Plugin to OpenGL
* Port ImageReader to portable CDI library
